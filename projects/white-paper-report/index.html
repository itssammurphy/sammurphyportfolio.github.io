        <h2>Do we supply enough foreign aid to Indonesia?</h2>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: none;">by Sam Murphy</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">Australia's intervention in the Indo-pacific is critical to ensuring stability in the region. COVID-19 has destabilised Indonesia's economy, and they need every bit of help they can get to get it back in motion. Australia must provide Indonesia with aid in a variety of key areas such as vaccine donation. By soliciting the help of other states, Australia could help protect its most strategic maritime partner. Additional aid will help ensure political stability in the region, as well as minimising the economic fallout of COVID. It will also help to reduce the risk of mass emigration - as people may flee in search of safer economic conditions. A mass emigration event could pose a risk to the stability of both the domestic and international economies.</p>

        <h1>Background Info</h1>
        <p>Australia provided an estimated $375.7 million in official development assistance in 2015-16. In response to a 2018 earthquake & tsunami, Australia pledged $5.5 million in relief aid to Indonesia. The current partnership covers a variety of areas, such as political, trade, and economic co-operation. Wealth inequality is a growing threat to Indonesia's economy. An inequality of opportunity, as well as high wealth concentration and unequal jobs are to blame for this. Indonesia also has lower financial resiliency, meaning financial shocks are more damaging. This is why the pandemic is such a pressing issue, as the Indonesian economy is struggling to keep up with the rest of the world. All of these factors contribute to a slower-growing economy, which is an area in which Australia has provided Indonesia with continued support.
        <br><br>
        The Australian Embassy in Indonesia's website lists three main objectives in their outline of the $375.7 million pledge. </p><br>

        <h1>A COVID-Affected Economy</h1>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="left">
            <p>In 2019, Indonesia reached many key  national milestones. Its poverty rate dropped below 10%, and had also attained a high human development index state.
            <br><br>
            However, the COVID-19 pandemic effectively stopped all this progress in its tracks. Data from March 2019 showed that 25 million people lived below the poverty line in Indonesia (~9% of their population), and a further 55 million (~21%) lived slightly above it. This showed that there was still a large susceptibility for people to become poor. As of May 2021, data has shown that up to 30% of Indonesia's population now lives in poverty.


            COVID also impacted people's access to essential services. This disproportionately affected financially vulnerable groups. 37% of households with children with disabilities were unable to access health care services such as therapy, and one in three of the lowest income households (bottom 40% of income) were not provided with any government-issued financial assistance.
            <br><br>
            The graph to the right also shows how COVID interrupted decades of steady economic growth, and in turn devastated the Indonesian economy.</p>

          <p>Helping Indonesia to provide aid to under-compensated citizens is of paramount importance. By doing this that we can restore public confidence in the government and maintain regional stability.
          <br><br>
          Not only do these measures ensure financial stability, it also helps maintain political stability. Maintaining public confidence is key for Indonesia's democratic participation. By maintaining strong democratic participation we can reduce the risk of extremism, as people won't be compelled to turn to drastic measures to ensure their security. This allows for regional stability.
          <br><br>
          Indonesia also needs aid in its direct response to the pandemic. Providing Indonesia with vaccines (or the money to acquire them) is key to this approach. Indonesia's vaccination rate is incredibly low, with only 29.2% of their citizens being fully vaccinated. In order to protect both people and the economy from the ongoing COVID threat, Australia (in partnership with other nations) must assist in providing Indonesia with vital doses, as well as supporting them in the roll-out of the vaccine.
          <br><br>
          By providing Indonesia with these essential health supplies, we can put them back on track to rebuilding their economy.

        <h1>Monetary Aid to Indonesia</h1>

          <div class="left">
            <h3>Goals of My Proposal</h3>
            <p>Under my proposal, Australia will provide more financial aid to Indonesia. This will primarily assist in stimulating the economy, allowing a swift recovery from COVID. Secondarily, it will assist in constructing the social programs Indonesia needs and wants. The aid will also help strengthen the independence of the Indo-pacific by establishing stronger maritime infrastructure.
            <br><br>
            On March 12, 2021 at the Quad - a quadrilateral summit meeting between the US, Japan, Australia and India, major powers discussed  issues in the region. China's rise to power is a major cause for concern, and as a result the Quad have formed a strategic alliance. Protecting Indonesia from coercion by the Chinese military is critical to protect Australia's foreign interests. This region is incredibly resource-rich, which provides great economic benefit to Indonesia.
            <br><br>
            It is critical that foreign powers do not interfere with our access to the region's resources due to their economic benefit. This is why we must protect our partner from military, political, and economic coercion.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <h3>Indonesia's Natural Resources</h3>
            <p>Indonesia exported approximately $3.1B of goods to Australia in 2019, and in return received roughly $4.5B in exports from Australia. Indonesia's largest export to Australia is refined petroleum, a resource which is incredibly valuable. Australia's still transitioning to renewables, which heightens petroleum's value here. Hence, it is important to maintain a strong presence in the region.
            <br><br>
            As we can see in the graph below, Indonesia's oil exports are declining rapidly. Oil is the backbone of the Indonesian economy, so it is critical we help establish infrastructure to export other goods. By exporting these in similar volumes, Indonesia can look to maintain economic solvency.</p>

        <h1>Stability in Indonesia</h1>
        <p>COVID-19 has had a severe affect on the crime reported in Indonesia. These cover a variety of domains, such as economic and cyber crimes.
        <br><br>
        Data into the effect of the pandemic on crime in Makassar City (a city on one of Indonesia's eastern islands) saw the monthly rate of theft crime almost double. Before COVID, theft cases occurred at a rate of roughly 12 per month, but during the COVID period there were over 170 cases over 6 months. The report also shed light onto the threat to residents from these crimes. There was evidence that thieves were moving out of the CBD and into residential areas. During the COVID period (March - August 2020), 47% of thefts occurred in residential homes. Only 20% occurred in the CBD.
        <br><br>
        Another report found mask and sanitiser hoarding caused unprecedented price fluctuations. It also found that online misinformation about COVID-19 remedies produced a similar effect.
        <br><br>
        The economic destabilisation caused by COVID may encourage citizens to flee in search of a safer economy. This may lead to a rise in illegal people-smuggling operations which Australia must assert a strong stance against. Furthermore, economic damage could cause a tendency towards political extremes. This leads to a rise in extremist movements in the region, which is against the best interests of all Indo-pacific nations.
        <br><br>
        By providing this essential aid to Indonesia, we can prevent these catastrophic side-effects. This would require the provision of monetary aid, as well as specialist expertise in economic planning. Providing the Indonesian government with access to the resources to maintain democratic participation is also crucial to Australia's Indo-pacific agenda.
