        <h2>Do we supply enough foreign aid to Indonesia?</h2>
        <h3 style="text-decoration: none;">by Sam Murphy</h3>
        <br>
        <p style="width: 90%; text-align: justify;">Australia needs to provide more aid to Indonesia in our current, COVID-affected world so as to ensure stability in the Indo-pacific region. Due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesia's economy needs every bit of support it can get, this includes monetary aid, vaccines etc. This aid would help to ensure stability in the region, increase security in Indonesia, as well as reduce the risk of mass emmigration which could destabilise the economy.</p>

        <h1>Background Info</h1>
        <p>Australia provided an estimated $375.7 million in official development assistance in 2015-16. In response to a 2018 earthquake & tsunami, Australia pledged $5.5 million in relief aid to Indonesia. Our current partnership encompasses a variety of areas, such as political, security, trade, economic and development cooperation. Wealth inequality is a growing threat to Indonesia's economy, influenced by 4 main factors: inequality of opportunity, high wealth concentration, unequal jobs, and low individual financial resiliency. This has caused a slowing of economic growth, an area in which Australia continues to support Indonesia. <br><br>The Australian Embassy in Indonesia's website lists three main objectives in their outline of the $375.7 million pledge.</p><br>

        <h1>A COVID-Affected Economy</h1>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="left">
            <p>In 2019, Indonesia reached many key milestones, its poverty rate dropped below 10% for the first time, and they had also reached the status of a high human development index state. However, the COVID-19 pandemic that dominated world headlines for nearly 2 years effectivelly stopped all this progress in its tracks. Data from March 2019 showed that 25 million people lived below the poverty line in Indonesia (~9% of their population), and a further 55 million (~21%) lived slightly above it. This showed that there was still a large susceptibility for people to become poor. As of May 2021, data has shown that up to 30% of Indonesia's population now lives in poverty.<br><br>COVID also impacted people's access to essential services, and groups which were already financially vulnerable where disproportionately affected by this. 37% of households with children with disabilities were unable to access health care services such as therapy, and one in three households living in the bottom 40% of households were not provided with any government-issued financial assistance of any sort. The graph to the right also shows how COVID interrupted decades of steady economic growth, and in turn devestated the Indonesian economy.</p>

          <p>Helping Indonesia provide aid to their under-compensated citizens is of paramount importance if we are to achieve our goals of maintaining stability in the region.
            <br><br>
          Not only does providing aid to Indonesia to help its citizens financially recover from the pandemic ensure financial stability, it also helps improve the public's confidence in their government, which is pivotal if democratic participation in Indonesia is to continue at the impressive rates which it has been known to recently. This reduces the risk of extremism in Indonesia as people will not turn to such drastic measures to seek financial security for themselves, which ties into the maintanence of regional stability.
          <br><br>
          Australia should focus on providing aid to Indonesia in the areas which help to combat the pandemic. This includes providing vaccines (or the financial means to acquire them). Indonesia has a very low vaccination rate, with only 46% of their citizens having received their first dose, and only 29.2% having been fully vaccinated. In order to protect both people and the economy from the dangers of COVID, Australia (in partnership with other nations) must assist in providing Indonesia with vital doses, as well as helping them with their roll-out of the vaccine.<br><br>By providing these essential health services to our maritime neighbour, we can help them get on track to rebuilding their economy sooner.

        <h1>Monetary Aid to Indonesia</h1>
        <div class="columns">
          <div class="left">
            <p>Under my proposal, Australia will provide more financial aid to Indonesia, primarily to give their economy the boost it needs after COVID, but also to ensure the social programs it wants to achieve are still feasible in a reasonable time frame. This aid will also help strengthen the independence of the Indo-pacific region by helping to establish stronger maritime infrastructure.<br><br>
            On March 12, 2021 at the Quad - a quadrilateral summit meeting between the US, Japan, Australia and India, the major powers in the Indo-pacific discussed pressing issues in the region. The rise of Chinese power in the region is a major cause for concern for these major political powers, and they have formed a strategic alliance in response to China's ever-growing presence. Protecting Indonesia from coercion as a result of Chinese military aggression is important to protect Australia's own military interests, as access to this area which is rich in natural resources provides great mutual economic benefit for both Australia and Indonesia.<br><br>
            Furthermore, it is critical that foreign powers do not interfere with our access to the region's resources, which is why we must protect our partners from military, political, and economic coercion.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <h3>Indonesia's Natural Resources</h3>
            <p>Indonesia exported approximately $3.1B of goods to Australia in 2019, and in return received roughly $4.5B in exports from Australia. Indonesia's top export to Australia is refined petroleum, a resource which is incredibly valuable to any economy, but especially to Australia's which is still transitioning to renewable energy, which is why it is important to maintain a strong presence in the region as well as the mutual trust with our maritime partners in the Indo-pacific.<br>
            As we can see in the graph below, Indonesia's oil exports are declining rapidly, and as oil is the backbone of the Indonesian economy, it is critical we help Indonesia establish infrastructure to export other goods in similar volumes in order to maintain economic solvency.</p>

        <h1>Stability in Indonesia</h1>
        <p>COVID-19 has had a severe affect on the crime reported in Indonesia. These cover a variety of domains, such as economic and cyber crimes.<br><br>
        Data into the effect of the pandemic on crime in Makassar City (a city on one of Indonesia's eastern islands) saw the monthly rate of theft crime almost double, going from an average of approximately 12 theft cases per month, to over 28, with a total of 170 theft crimes occurring between March and August 2020. The same report also shed light on the transition of these theft crimes from occurring in the CBD to occurring in residents' homes, with 47% of the theft cases reported during COVID occurring in residential homes, and only 20% occurring in the CBD.
        <br><br>
        Another report found that the hoarding of masks and hand sanitisers by people in the early stages of the pandemic, as well as the spreading misinformation regarding COVID-19 remedies, caused massive price fluctuations in masks and food products.
        <br><br>
        The economic destabilisation that has occurred as a result of COVID may also encourage citizens to flee the country in search of a safer economy. This may lead to a rise in illegal people-smuggling operations which Australia must assert a strong stance against. Furthermore, the economic damage could cause more people to tend towards political extremes, which will lead to the rise of extremist movements in the region, the prevention of which is in the best interests of all Indo-pacific nations.
        <br><br>
        By providing Indonesia with essential aid, we can help prevent these devestating side effects from developing. This would involve us providing monetary aid, as well as providing specialist expertise in economic planning and providing the Indonesian government with the resources to maintain strong democratic participation, and maintain the public's confidence in their government.
