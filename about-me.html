      <div class="justified-content">
        <p>Hi there, I'm Sam Murphy, a 15 year-old aspiring software developer from Melbourne, Australia.
        This is my website! I (surprisingly) made this myself. This is where I will be
        showcasing my coding projects and help develop my skills with HTML/CSS. This
        website will be undergoing almost constant change as I try to tune every minute
        detail of it to my liking, so watch this space! To follow my coding development,
        join my <a href="discord.html">discord server</a>, a place where like-minded developers can collaborate and
        share ideas about projects.
        <br><br>
        I have been incredibly interested in software and programming since 2014.
        I learnt to code in Python when I was in Year 3 at school, and continued to
        use Python to solve coding problems on a daily basis in my free time. I am
        currently learning Java, and have previously used languages such as JavaScript
        and C++. I have an interest in IoT and web development, and want to expand
        my skills in these areas, hence this website's existence.</p>

      <h1>Beyond Programming</h1>
      <div class="justified-content">
        <p>Beyond programming, I play a <i>lot</i> of sport. In summer, I play cricket
        and throughout the rest of the year I always try to find some time to slot
        a round of golf in. I also play video games (probably a bit more than I am
        happy admitting), and recently have been fixated on Splitgate and Rocket
        League.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>My Goals</h1>
      <div class="justified-content">
        <p>Back to the matter at hand though, I want to use this website as a place to
        share my development in coding with people, and share any cool or useful
        projects that may eventuate from this journey. I also hope that this website
        can help me network with people whom with I can collaborate with on future projects,
        and help further expand my skills in a diverse range of programming fields.</p>
