<p>This is my website! I (surprisingly) made this myself. This is where
  I will be showcasing my coding projects and help develop my skills with
  HTML/CSS. This website will be undergoing almost constant change as I
  try to tune every minute detail of it to my liking, so watch this space!
  To follow my coding development, join my discord server, a place where
  like-minded developers can collaborate and share ideas about projects.</p>

<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>My name is Sam Murphy. I am a 15 year-old developer from Melbourne, Australia.
I have been incredibly interested in software and programming since 2014.
I learnt to code in Python when I was in Year 3 at school, and continued to
use Python to solve coding problems on a daily basis in my free time. I am
currently learning Java, and have previously used languages such as JavaScript
and C++. I have an interest in IoT and web development, and want to expand
my skills in these areas, hence this website's existence.
<br/><br/>
Beyond programming, I play a <i>lot</i> of sport. In summer, I play cricket
and throughout the rest of the year I always try to find some time to slot
a round of golf in. I also play video games (probably a bit more than I am
happy admitting), and recently have been fixated on Splitgate and Rocket
League.
<br/><br/>
Back to the matter at hand though, I want to use this website as a place to
share my development in coding with people, and share any cool or useful
projects that may eventuate from this journey. I also hope that this website
can help me network with people whom with I can collaborate with on projects,
and help further expand my skills in a diverse range of programming fields.
