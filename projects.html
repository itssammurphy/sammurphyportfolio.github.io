      <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">A* Pathfinding Visualisation</h1>
      <div class="left-content">
        <p><b>In this project, I learned to create a Python implementation of the A* Pathfinding algorithm.</b><br><br>
        Asides from being possibly the most commonly cited programming examples, A* is a highly efficient pathfinding algorithm which many
        programmers turn to due to it's incredible efficiency (caused by its best-first approach rather than brute force).<br><br>
        Other pathfinding algorithms do exist - notably Dijkstra's Shortest Path, but I chose to work with A* for this project as it is
        a more optimal search algorithm. A* is simply an expansion on Dijkstra's algorithm which adds a heuristic function to help navigate
        the search towards the goal more efficiently, rather than purely based on the weights of the paths.<br><br>
        On the right, you can see a screenshot of what my visualisation looks like on a solved puzzle. I used various colours to depict
        the functions each cell was taking. For example, the red squares are squares that are <i>no longer being considered by the algorithm</i>,
        green cells are cells that are in the <i>open set</i>, awaiting consideration. As a path has been found, the blue line indicates the shortest
        path from A -> B as found by the algorithm. The start and end points are hidden but are coloured orange and purple respectively.<br><br>
        This project is only dependent on PyGame, and a Python 3.8+ install.<br><br>
